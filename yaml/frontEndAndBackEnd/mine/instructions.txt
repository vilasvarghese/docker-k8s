The actual app and the Dockerfile for this can be found in 
/home/vagrant/docker-k8s/dockerfiles/frontEndAndBackEnd/webfrontend-mysqldb

cd /home/vagrant/docker-k8s/dockerfiles/frontEndAndBackEnd/webfrontend-mysqldb

Understand the dockerfile and the associated app by doing  vi Dockerfile.dockerfile
	The front end connects to a service with the name mysqldb

We have already pushed a docker image into the dockerhub. Instructions used for the same are..
	sudo docker  build -f Dockerfile.dockerfile -t vilasvarghese/k8sfrontend .
	docker login -u vilasvarghese 
	docker push vilasvarghese/k8sfrontend

Now let's create a back end along with it's service.
	kubectl create -f mysql.yaml

A Service creates a 
	persistent IP address and 
	DNS name entry so that the 
	backend microservice can always be reached. 
	A Service uses selectors to find the Pods that it routes traffic to.



Now let's create the frontend for the same along with it's service.
	kubectl create -f frontend.yaml

The frontend connects to the backend worker Pods by using the DNS name given to the backend Service. The DNS name is "mysqldb", which is the value of the name field in the Service customers.jsp.
